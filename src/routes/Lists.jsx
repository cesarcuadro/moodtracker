/*
This List component is basically going to be like a todo list
The only difference is that instead of submitting one item, it needs at least three
What does that mean?
  have a text area 3x
  wrap that up in a form
  Form? maybe make it like a regular input form stacked on top of each other
  how to handle submitting all three at once?
  does it need to be formatted before being displayed?
